## Chrome Extension: Codtech Tracker

## ðŸ“„ Description

Codtech Tracker is a lightweight and user-friendly Chrome extension that allows users to register, log in, and track their progress or activity directly from the browser. It is built with Firebase Authentication and stores user-specific data securely using a custom backend server.


##  Features

* User Registration & Login (with Firebase Auth)
* Tracks data specific to the logged-in user
* Stores tracked data to MongoDB via Express backend
* Easy access through Chrome popup
* Clean and responsive UI


##  How It Works

1. **User registers/logs in** through the popup UI.
2. **Firebase Authentication** handles login securely.
3. On successful login, the **access token** is fetched.
4. User activity/data is tracked and **sent to a local Express server** (`localhost:4000`) which stores it in **MongoDB**.
5. All interactions happen within the popup, making the experience seamless.


##  Technologies Used

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
